Known issues
------------
Known issues in this release are listed below:
- Filesystem creation with quota config
    - Setting quota configuration while creating a filesystem may sometime observe delay in fetching the details about the quota config of the new filesystem. The module will throw an error to rerun the task to see expected result.
    
- Mapping and unmapping of hosts for a Consistency group
    - Interoperability between Ansible Unity playbooks and Unisphere REST API is not supported for mapping and unmapping of hosts for a consistency group.
      > **WORKAROUND:** It is recommended to use Ansible Unity modules consistently for all mapping and unmapping of hosts for a consistency group instead of partially/mutually doing it through Unisphere and Ansible modules.

Limitations
-----------
There are no known limitations.
