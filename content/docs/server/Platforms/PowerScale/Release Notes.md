- Modify user, groups, filesystem, access zone, NFS export, smart quotas, SMB share, snapshot and snapshot schedule of a filesystem.
- Delete user, groups, filesystem, NFS export, smart quotas, SMB share, snapshot and snapshot schedule of a filesystem.

Known issues
------------
Known problems in this release are listed.
 
- Snapshot schedule  
    - If the playbook has a desired_retention field, running same the playbook again returns the changed as True (Idempotency does not work).
     
- Filesystem Creation 
    - Creation of a filesystem can fail when api_user: "admin" because it is possible that the admin user may not have privileges to set an ACLs. 
      
     - In that case, create a filesystem with api_user: "root".
    
- Snapshot creation with alias name
    - Alias name attribute remains null in spite of creating snapshot with alias name.
    - This is an issue with PowerScale rest API. Alias name is not getting appended to the attribute in response.
